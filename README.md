## Abstract
Climate change is significantly affecting global agricultural productivity, impacting crop yields, farmer incomes, and food security. This project explores the relationships between climate variables like temperature, precipitation, and COâ‚‚ emissions and their effects on crop yields. By integrating agricultural price data, we analyze the economic consequences of climate-induced productivity changes. The solution includes an interactive dashboard, predictive models, and actionable insights to support policymakers and farmers in adapting to climate change. The project highlights optimal temperature ranges for crops, the warming trend in regions like the U.S., and the economic instability caused by erratic precipitation.

## Commentary on the Project Process
This project was an exciting yet challenging journey. The process began with understanding the domain of climate change and agriculture, followed by extensive data preprocessing to integrate datasets from diverse sources. The most rewarding part was designing the dashboard to make complex data intuitive and actionable. Challenges included handling missing data, optimizing the regression model for accurate predictions, and ensuring the dashboard's responsiveness.
